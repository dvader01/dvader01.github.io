Hi there, I am Matthias and I am a software engineer, writer, blogger, speaker and community organizer from Hamburg, Germany. I am mostly interested in fullstack web development and data visualization. When it comes to data visualization, I am particularly interested in data about **now**, with live updates. 

Go check out my projects on **[GitHub](https://github.com/matthiasn)**. 

My first book is supposed to come out in November 2014, it is about **[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org)** and already available for pre-order over at **[Packt Publisher](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/angularjs-ui-development)**.

I also recently kicked off the **[Hamburg AngularJS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Hamburg-AngularJS-Meetup/)**. 

Please get in touch for project ideas, questions and suggestions regarding blog posts, talk ideas for the meetup, conference talks and geeking out. Note for recruiters: do read a little on here before contacting me. If you don't have a pitch for why anything would be particularly good match for me, our conversation is going to be very short. But then again, you will probably not have read this page either.

Note that I am using the Amazon Affiliate program to monetize this blog so I don't have to cover all of the costs for running live instances of the tools that I am building myself. In particular I am paying about $100 a months for a server that hosts the **[BirdWatch](http://birdwatch.matthiasnehlsen.com/#/)** application and the blog itself. So if you click any product links on here, yes, Amazon will track you and try to sell you stuff. But do not worry, your purchases at Amazon will serve a good purpose.
