Two weeks ago, I started working on **["Building a System in Clojure"](https://leanpub.com/building-a-system-in-clojure)**, a book about building complex applications in Clojure and ClojureScript. I continue to be thrilled by how many readers the book already got.

In the last couple of days, I have made quite a bit of progress.


Happy New Year,
Matthias
