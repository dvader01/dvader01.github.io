This weekly update is mostly about organizational isssues around publishing articles and getting feedback for unfinished articles.

## Test environment for my blog
This week, I published the unfinished second article in the **Writing a System in Clojure** series for a getting some preliminary feedback, but without announcing the article just yet. What I did not think about though was RSS aggregators, so that was a little less than ideal on my part. Ideally, I should have a different way of publishing unfinished stuff in order to get feedback and then only have finalized articles on this blog.

So I came up with something different: a **staging server**. Just like I would want a test environment when developing an application, I also want a test environment for new articles. So I've pulled the unfinished article from master for now and put the unfinished article here:

**[http://staging.matthiasnehlsen.com/blog/2014/10/01/Building-System-in-Clojure-2/](http://staging.matthiasnehlsen.com/blog/2014/10/01/Building-System-in-Clojure-2/)**

I'd love to get more feedback still. But what I got so far was also very helpful. Right now I am working on illustrating the mechanisms with some illustrations and I expect to be done with everything on Monday. I will also probably split the article in two as the current article is probably a little long.

## Closing remarks
Most importantly, check out the new **[article series](/blog/2014/09/24/Building-Systems-in-Clojure-1/)** that I just started. I hope you will find it useful and I am looking forward to your feedback. In addition, there have been plenty of new entries to my **[Clojure-Resources](https://github.com/matthiasn/Clojure-Resources)** repository on GitHub. You may want to check that out if you're interested in Clojure at all. Finally, I bought a useful gadget that makes my digital life a little better.

Until next week,
Matthias
