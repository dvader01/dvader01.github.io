So I have been suffering a little from writer's block recently. Well, no, that is not exactly true. The problem was not getting started with a topic but rather sticking with it and continuing to work on it. But there might be a way to get back into the rhythm and that is by finishing something smaller.

<!-- more -->

Looking at my past articles, I seem to have a tendency to go for the long form. While I do not find that wrong as such, I do want to be able to do both long and short articles. Ideally I would have a long article (or three) in the works but at the same time publish short ideas and random ramblings in the meantime. Sometimes with code, sometimes without.

**So here's to a new approach for this blog.** I will still come out with large and (hopefully) profound articles from time to time, so nothing changes on that front. But in addition I will also more frequently post shorter notes. Or at least that's the idea. Let's see how it works.

Regarding the existing newsletter, I am not exactly sure how to leverage that. As a subscriber, you have become accustomed to getting an email once or sometimes twice per month. I don't want to spam you much more frequently all of a sudden. Maybe I should create another newsletter for the more frequent updates? I'm curious about your thoughts. For now I will just announce this change once and then keep using the current newsletter only for the more infrequent large articles.

Cheers,
Matthias
