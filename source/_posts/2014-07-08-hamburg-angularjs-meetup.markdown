Hamburg is the second largest city in Germany, and as such it really should have an **AngularJS Meetup**. It did not have one until now, so I founded one.

<!-- more -->

I have done server side development for the most part over the last seven months but I finally had a chance to write an internal web application at work using **[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org)** and I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this process. AngularJS provides you with a really quite useful way of structuring an application with services, controllers, directives, centralized configuration and most importantly **[dependency injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)** for wiring parts of an application together.

While doing work on the AngularJS application I noticed that I did not really have enough people to talk to when it comes to single page applications and user experience so I started looking for a nearby **[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org)** meetup. 

To my surprise, there was none in Hamburg yet. After all, **[Hamburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg)** is the second largest city in Germany with well over 2 million people when you include the suburbs. I do believe it should have such a meetup so I founded the **[Hamburg AngularJS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Hamburg-AngularJS-Meetup/)**. Please do join if you agree with me that this meetup was still missing. 

A first Meetup is scheduled for **Monday, July 21st, 2014 at 7pm**. There is no venue for the event yet, so please let me know if you would like to sponsor the meetup by providing a location or know anyone who can provide the space. There is also no agenda as of yet. Please let me know if you have anything AngularJS-related that you would like to talk about or that you are particularly interested in.

Cheers,
Matthias
