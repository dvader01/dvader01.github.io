Last week was great. I had just come back from my trip to the United States the week before, where I attended the **[Conj](http://clojure-conj.org)** and got to hang out with dear friends in both Washington DC and New York City. I used to live in DC in 2009 and 2010, and it was really good to be back. Last Friday, I had a talk about my **[BirdWatch](https://github.com/matthiasn/BirdWatch)** application and my journey to Clojure at **[Clojure eXchange](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1956-clojure-exchange-2014)** in London. I think there should be a recording somewhere, but I haven’t checked it out just yet. The day before that, I had parted from **[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org)** with a **[farewell letter](http://matthiasnehlsen.com/blog/2014/12/04/Farewell-Scala/)** here on this blog. It took me by surprise how much attention this little letter received [^1], considering that it was really only between Scala and me.

I am glad that relationship is over with. Let me just make clear that I don’t hate Scala. I built some interesting stuff with it in the past. But it is just not as much fun as **[Clojure](http://clojure.org)** is and that’s extremely important to me. I came to be a programmer after 10 years of project and operations management in healthcare IT [^2], all while running my own company and managing employees. I did that until it was no challenge any longer. Then I thought, hey, building software myself should be plenty of fun and shouldn’t be all that difficult if done right. But none of the technologies I worked with so far (C#, Java, JavaScript, Scala) had sparked the excitement that I was looking for. Well, that has definitely changed with Clojure.

I do not have major new results to report on the **[BirdWatch](https://github.com/matthiasn/BirdWatch)** front this week, as I was mostly busy with other stuff (such as taxes and actual work). But I did change the design and kicked out **[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)** in favor of **[Pure CSS](http://purecss.io)**, which not only looks good by default but is also tiny in comparison to Bootstrap. That’s not deployed anywhere just yet except for my development machine, but you can either run it yourself or wait a couple of days until I deploy it together with some of the current work in progress. Here’s a peek of how the new design looks like:

Much better, I find. I had really developed distaste for the old Bootstrap look over the course of the year. Next I want to replace **[D3](http://d3js.org/)**, at least for the bar chart generation. I’d much rather manipulate the **[SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics)** in **[ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript)** and build the charts myself. Is this going to save me time? Probably not, but this is a toy project, so what does saving time in that context even mean? I am interested in manipulating graphical elements directly from ClojureScript and that’s what matters. I have made good progress so far, but nothing that I’d want to present just yet, maybe next week.

Also I was able to put some more thought into server-side aggregation. But again, nothing for this week, please check back soon.

Oh, before I forget, I will present at the **[Clojure Meetup in Hamburg](http://www.meetup.com/ClojureUserGroupHH/events/218689956/)** next week on Thursday. Please come out and say hi if you're anywhere near.

Cheers,
Matthias

[^1]: Thanks to Hacker News, there were like an extra **30K** pageviews on my blog during the first 36 hours after publishing the farewell note. I should publicly part more often, I guess.

[^2]: Okay, I did write some software myself at that time, but my involvement with software development was was mostly overseeing development done by others.
