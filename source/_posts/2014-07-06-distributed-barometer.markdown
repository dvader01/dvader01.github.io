Later this month I will be doing a hiking tour in the Alps around the **[Matterhorn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matterhorn)**. I do not recall exactly why I said yes to this tour; maybe because I did not know at that point that in ten days the total ascent would be **10,500 meters** (roughly 34,500 feet). But on the other hand, that's an interesting challenge for a person with a sedentary job.
Now being me, I would love to have a way to track the current altitude plus the combined ascent. **[GPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System)** can help here, but the best sensor to have for this task appears to be a **[barometer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer)**.

GPS sensors only have an accuracy of **[Â±45m in the vertical axis](http://www.xcmag.com/2011/07/gps-versus-barometric-altitude-the-definitive-answer/)**, making them less than ideal for measuring combined ascent unless readings are averaged over longer periods. Averaging would not only alias the otherwise occuring zigzag lines from the measurement errors though but also real ups and downs in the terrain that really should be measured. A barometer can capture these small changes much better, however it is prone to a shift over the day as the atmospheric pressure changes with the weather. It appears as if the averaged GPS readings, while not all that useful for capturing altitude changes in unknown terrain, could be used to correct the barometric height from time to time. When the barometric height deviates more than 45m from the averaged GPS altutide, we know that a correction is due.

In addition to providing a higher resolution when continously measuring altitude changes, a barometric sensor also consumes much less energy than a GPS sensor, making this sensor type particularly suitable for continous monitoring.

Thinking about barometric sensors I found two articles (**[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2014/06/19/iphone-6-likely-to-include-barometer-for-super-accurate-local-weather/)**, **[9to5mac](http://9to5mac.com/2014/06/18/iphone-6-likely-to-sport-barometer-air-pressure-sensors-to-measure-altitude-weather/)**) pointing at the upcoming **iPhone 6** having such a sensor. First of all, **Apple**, that's a little late for my tour. Can I get prototype, please? Anyhow, I find pressure sensors in connected devices really exciting, even when I cannot use the sensor for the upcoming tour just yet.

I am not an expert in **[meteorology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology)**, but in my layman's understanding of the subject, **[atmospheric pressure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure)** changes are one of the most essential measurable phenomena that weather forecasts revolve around. This makes total sense when you think about it. Wind brings weather change. Most of the clouds here in **[Hamburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg)** where I live are not formed spontaneously above my apartment building but are instead blown there by the wind from somewhere above the Atlantic Ocean. **[Wind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind)** is a manifestation of atmospheric pressure change. Let's assume that at my current location the atmospheric pressure is higher in the west and lower in the east, then in the tendency to go back to equilibrium, air will flow from the high pressure field to the low pressure field, which I will then perceive as **[west wind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_wind)**. 

Have you ever noticed a gust of wind before an adverse weather event like a thunderstorm? This gust of wind, besides being the title of a song on **[Pharell's new album](https://itunes.apple.com/en/album/g-i-r-l/id823593445)**, is a sudden change in pressure and I am pretty sure that would be measurable by a **[barometric sensor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_sensor)** in a mobile device. Now imagine you have such a sensor in every smartphone and all of them are constantly sending the current atmospheric pressure together with GPS coordinates. I really wonder what that would mean for the accuracy of **[weather forecasts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting)**. I suspect they could become more accurate as they will feed realtime data back into the models, allowing to correct predictions. But at the same time, I also wonder how one would process all that extra data, with millions of sensors that move instead of being in fixed places. I'm sure this will not make the predictive models simpler. There are all kinds of interesting questions around this. For example how do you know that a sensor is on the ground? A sudden pressure change could also have been caused by getting on an elevator, particularly in a high-rise building. Maybe only sensor data from moving targets should be used. How about collecting that data when a turn-by-turn navigation app is used? Then the altitude of the reading is fairly predictable, namely a few feet above the street. And the altitude of that street is typically known and does not change. 

I'm all for using such data when it can keep me from getting wet or otherwise affected by adverse weather conditions. However, I believe there should be open standards on how this data is transmitted. I understand that this data only makes sense with embedded GPS location that ought to be precise to be most valuable. But at the same time **I am not okay with my device constantly leaking my location together with identifiable data**. My device ID or any other information related to me is not necessary for the noble task of making weather forecasts better and as such should not be included. In German we have a word for this: **Datensparsamkeit**. Martin Fowler did a **[good job of translating the concept](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Datensparsamkeit.html)** into English. Just because we can store every piece of information we can get our hands on does not mean that that's always a great idea.

But with that being said, I find the idea of having millions of additional and moving sensors for atmospheric pressure changes **fascinating**. This real-time data could prove just as useful for refining weather models as it did for improving navigation by getting traffic data from smart phones moving with their owners in their cars (or not in the case of a traffic jam). By the way, does anyone know what data exactly the devices send back for live traffic? Once again, there is a case to be made for an open standard for anonymized sensor data and **[Datensparsamkeit](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Datensparsamkeit.html)**.

Until next time,
