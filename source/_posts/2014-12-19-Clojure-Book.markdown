I thought about where to take my series about **[Building a System in Clojure]()** next and realized that I don't like the format of a blog series all that much. Instead, the format of a **book** seems like a better choice, one where you, the potential reader, is invited to provide feedback from the very first moment of the writing process. The book will freely be available on **[leanpub.com]()**. Choosing this platform allows a model where you can sign up to read the book for free. Iff (if and only if) you find the content to be of value to you, you can pay a suggested price, but that's entirely up to you.

The book format will allow to write a consistent narrative around the flow of data through a system, where we will follow the journey of data from the streaming source to a user interface that updates changes according to new data from the streaming source close to immediately, within a few hundred microseconds.

As a sample application, we will tweets streaming live from the Twitter Streaming API. In case you haven't seen it yet, this is how it looks like:

There's also a live demo of this application. I have ideas for additional sample applications, but those may or may not come into existence, depending on how much time I will have for this book project.

The process of writing this book will happen while exploring the problem space, not after the fact. All designs and implementations are fluid at this point and I will be happy to discuss all aspects of the system in this **[Google Group]()** and adapt and rewrite when better solutions arise in these discussions. You are also welcome to join the development process, do reach out when you have a suggestion on how to get involved. The projects needs tests, better inline documentation, code reviews and quite possibly better design and code. Regarding the book writing process, first and foremost I would love questions for clarification so the content will come out as approachable as possible. If you find a typo, please correct it and submit a **[pull request]()** right away.

I am looking forward to the weeks to come. Much better to be able to put some work in here and there, whatever I'm interested in that day instead of writing monolithic blog posts that aim at conclusively covering an aspect of the application, usually way before I have any conclusive understanding.

Can I ask you for a favor, as a little christmas present? Please sign up as a reader (for free and with not commitment whatsoever) right away if you think you might at all be interested in what we'll cover in this book. I am very much interested in how much interest there might be and I promise I will try what I can to make your time spent on reading this book or contributing worth your while.

Cheers and Happy Holidays,
Matthias
