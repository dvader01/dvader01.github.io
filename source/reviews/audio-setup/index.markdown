Recently I blew a fuse and threw out my 80lbs Onkyo receiver together with the entire **[THX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THX)** surround sound system. Okay, I did not literally throw that stuff out of the window but instead sold it all for two point something grand. What had happened?

## There were couple of reasons:
* I wanted to reorganize my apartment and the rear speakers were in the way.
* I don't need surround sound, a good stereo image is much higher on my list. Really, surround sound sucks you into what's happening on screen? Try a good story.
* I wanted to reduce my footprint, including power consumption. That Onkyo receiver was crazy power hungry. Even when idle you'd almost burn your fingers when touching it. The next thing that'll go is the Samsung 52" Plasma TV. That thing also doubles as a heater. I measured it's consumption and when the image is bright, it eats well over 500 Watts. Think about that for a second. No way to power that with a treadmill. You'd need a horse to generate that kind of power. You'd also have to build a contraption that couples the horse with an **[electric generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator)**.
* Apple TV is horrible for throwing a party. No sound is, too. The music playing (or not) makes the difference between the party being in full swing at 2 am or you already having the cleaning lights on at half past midnight. At every party there are always people wanting to play something from their smartphones. That's fine, but I under no circumstances want to interrupt the music. So I wanted to have multiple inputs for such devices that can be faded in and out simultaneously.

## Solution
Instead of a fancy surround sound system I now bought this mixer:

In addition to that I am using a pair of ADAM A7. These are amazing active speakers. I already had them but wasn't using them enough recently. Unfortunately you won't get new ones any more but this is the successor:

</iframe>

The price is per unit, not per pair, and they are **totally worth it**. My setup is that the TV out and two 3.5mm jacks (for Smartphone, Tablet) are connected to stereo sources. Video sources are connected to the TV, thus whatever signal is playing on the screen will play on the audio out of the TV.

I find that this setup works really well and sounds better than the previous and much more expensive expensive surround sound system. And using it is much more fun. I really like the feel of adjusting real faders. Sure, 100mm faders would be nicer still, but the tactile feel and repsonsiveness of 60mm faders is already much better than what any remote control could ever offer. Granted, the mixer is near the couch and desk, so your mileage may vary when trying to replace a home audio system with the setup I describe here.

The mixer also has a built-in USB audio interface. I have listened to a lot of music over this interface in the last couple of weeks and I have no complaints. Sure, there are better interfaces on the market, but this sounds great in my setup already. 

When it comes to headphones, I like the more power-hungry kind, like these:

They sound amazing when connected to a decent **[headphone amp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headphone_amplifier)** but flat, boring and not loud enough when directly connected to a smartphone or laptop. The reason for this is the impedance of the headphones. Read more about that topic **[here](http://nwavguy.blogspot.de/2011/02/headphone-impedance-explained.html)**. All this is to say that I really like what I hear when I connect the headphones to the Behringer mixer.

Okay, this is my current audio setup. It is also great for working from home, I can either use the headphones or crank up the speakers until my ears hurt while coding.

I have some ideas on how to use the mixer closer to its originally intended purpose, but more about that another time. As the central hub for audio playback, it is already doing a really good job.
