Recently I blew a fuse and threw out my 80lbs Onkyo receiver together with the entire THX surround system. Okay, I did not literally threw that stuff out of the window but instead sold it all for two point something grand. What had happened?

## There are couple of reasons:
* I wanted to reorganize my apartment and the rear speakers were in the way.
* I don't need surround sound, a good stereo image is much higher on my list. Really, surround sound sucks you into what's happening on screen? Try a good story.
* I wanted to reduce my footprint, including power consumption. That Onkyo receiver was crazy power hungry. Even when idle you'd almost burn your fingers when touching it. The next thing that'll go is the Samsung 52" Plasma TV. That thing also doubles as a heater. I measured it's consumption and when the image is bright, it consumes well over 500 Watts. Think about that for a second. No way to power that with a treadmill. You'd need a horse to power a contraption that generates motion into electricity.
* Apple TV is horrible for throwing a party. No sound is, too. The music playing (or not) makes the difference between the party being in full swing at 2 am or you already having the cleaning lights on at half past midnight. Well, if you are the kind of person who cleans right away, which I am decidedly not. At every party there are always people wanting to play something from their smartphones. That's fine, but I under no circumstances want to interrupt the music.

## Solution
Instead of a fancy surround sound system I now bought this mixer:

In addition to that I am using amazing active speakers that I still had but didn't use much. The speakers are Adam A7. Unfortunately you won't get new ones any more but this is the successor:

The price is per unit, not per pair, and they are totally worth it. My setup is that the TV out and two 3.5mm jacks (for Smartphone, Tablet) are connected to stereo sources. Video sources are connected to the TV, thus whatever signal is playing will play on the TV audio out.

I find that this setup works really well and sounds better than the previous and much more expensive expensive surround sound system. And using it is much more fun. I really like the feel of adjusting real faders. Sure, 100mm faders would be nicer still, but the tactile feel and repsonsiveness of 60mm faders is still much better than any remote control could ever offer. Granted, the mixer is near the couch, so your mileage may vary when trying to replace a home audio system with the setup I describe here.

The mixer also has a built-in USB audio interface. While there are certainly better interfaces on the market, I listen to most of my music from may laptop and have this built-in interface do the D/A conversion and I don't have complaints. 

When it comes to headphones, I like the more power-hungry kind, like these:

They sound amazing when connected to a decent headphone amp but flat, boring and not loud enough when directly connected to a smartphone or laptop. The reason for this is the impedance of the headphones. Read more about that topic **[here](http://nwavguy.blogspot.de/2011/02/headphone-impedance-explained.html)**. All this is to say that I really like what I hear when I connect the headphones to the Behringer mixer.

Okay, this is my current audio setup. It is great for working from home, I can either use the headphones or crank up the speakers until my ears hurt while coding.
