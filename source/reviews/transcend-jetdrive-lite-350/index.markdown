Overall, I am really happy with my **2012 Retina MacBook**. The only real issue is that even the 512 GB solid state disk is too small. I constantly run into a full drive. Now I could buy the latest version with 1TB, but other than the bigger drive, I am not too impressed with the improvements over the one that I already have, so I'd rather wait. 

Sure, I could also connect an external drive over **USB 3.0**, but that's pretty annoying when on the move. If only there was a way to add additional internal storage. It turns out there is a way. At first I thought about buying one of these **Nifty MiniDrives** with a large enough MicroSD card:

But there are some issues with that.

* **MicroSD** cards are way **slower** than regular SD cards
* **MicroSD** card are much **more expensive** than regular SD cards
* An adapter plus a card means one more set of electrical contacts than strictly necessary. I would like to avoid that. 

Regular SD cards are also not a real option. While the laptop still fits into my sleeve with an inserted and protruding SD card, I am afraid that a strong impact on the side of the sleeve would damage the slot or even more inside the MacBook. So what to do?

I found a somewhat shortened but otherwise regular SD card from Transcend that only protrudes about 1mm and that has a rim that protects the SD card slot from forces driving the SD card inside. Here's how that looks like:

With this, I was able to alleviate the imminent shortage of disk space on my MacBook pro. Sure, this is much slower than the internal storage. But for example for photos or the iTunes library, this works just fine. You probably want to format the drive using the **Mac OS extended** format in the **[Disk Utility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_Utility)** first. After doing this, I moved my 90GB iTunes library onto the drive and pointed to that new location by creating a **[symbolic link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link)**. Then, I moved some 20GB of images onto the drive. Et voil√°, I had over a hundred GB of extra drive space on my Mac again.

There is really only one issue I noticed: regular standby / sleep is fine, after waking up, the drive is still mounted. But not so when the system shuts down at 0% battery capacity. In that case, after waking up, the drive is not there any more. Then, you either need to remove the card and plug it back in or restart the laptop. I assume **[safe sleep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_(OS_X\))** is to blame here, where the content of the memory is saved to disk when the battery capacity is too low to maintain regular standby.

That's not the biggest issue for me, really. I try to avoid safe sleep anyway because I find it annoying how long it takes to wake the system up again. Not a surprise, really, when you consider that potentially all 16GB of RAM need to be rehydrated from SSD, but still.

## Conclusion
Overall, I am happy I made this purchase and I can recommend it to you. The Jetdrive allows me to use my MacBook for a little longer without constantly having to free disk space. I only wish there were larger options available. But who knows, maybe there will be a **256GB version** at some point?
