The one computer I am doing all my work on is a **2012 15" Retina Macbook with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD**. I have no reason to upgrade a single day before the extended warranty is up, considering the single digit percentages that the new machines are faster than this one. Only the drive space is not enough because of all the VMs that I like to have with me. Of course, that would have been a good excuse to buy a new Retina Macbook, but I try to use gadgets longer these days because that is just more sustainable. Just think about all the **[rare earth minerals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_earth_mineral)** that are needed for a laptop or smart phone.

The other day, in order to alleviate the shortage of disk space, I moved my 90GB iTunes library onto a **Transcend JetDrive Lite 350**. Then, I just pointed to that new location by creating a symbolic link.
