I like photography. Particularly with my selection of classic, manual focus Leica and Zeiss prime lenses. I really loved taking photos with my old Leica SLR. Now that is a beautiful camera:

But beautiful and fun to use does make up for one minor but still missing feature. Did you spot it above? That was not a typo, the D of DSLR is indeed missing. While I do have the intention of using my Leica with film again at some point, I just do not seem to get around to doing so. And then the lab situation. A mere ten years ago there were a couple of good to great profesional photo labs. The kind were you talk to the person developing your film and printing your photos, asking them to just pull out a little bit of magenta and add a little yellow, just like last week. Or you'd do an experiment with her, with different filter settings to work out what looks best. Those days are gone and most of those labs are out of business. Before digital, they were serving the professional market. As the advertising and media capital of the country, there are lots of professional photographers in the Hamburg, with the vast majority of course having an all-digital workflow today.

This is not to sound too nostalgic, I love digital photography. I previously used a Canon 5D, with a couple of Canon and third-party lenses. And while all that works alright, I am just not excited about the equipment. The haptic perception is that of plastic and I don't love how the photos look. Instead I like fast **[prime lenses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_lens)**.

If only there were a way to keep using these old and great lenses, ideally on a camera with a **[full-frame (24*36mm) digital sensor](http://digital-photography-school.com/full-frame-sensor-vs-crop-sensor-which-is-right-for-you/)**. I tried using the lenses with an adapter in front the Canon 5D but the results were usually gruesome because it was next to impossible to properly focus. I installed a different **[focusing screen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focusing_screen)** with a microprism ring but while the same technology worked nicely in the Leica, the 5D would not let enough light shine through to the focusing screen, rendering the microprism useless.

So for a while I had the lenses just laying around until I heard about the **Sony A7**, a compact full-frame camera with live view on the screen and a high-resolution **[electronic viewfinder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_viewfinder)** (EVF):

With plenty of adapters for different lens mounts available, I had to give this camera a try. It is not the last camera I will every buy, but it is a huge improvement over my previous digital photography experience. Let's look at a few results next.
