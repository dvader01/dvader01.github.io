I like books and gadgets. Who doesn't? When it comes to books, I read a lot but I also forget almost as much. So I decided to take notes. I took that decision years ago, but I never followed up on it. So in order to force myself to take notes, I will do this publicly. The main purpose of these notes is that I can go back and refresh my memory about what I read some time ago. And if these notes help you figure out whether you want to buy a book or not, so much the better.

Regarding the gadgets, I usually have a gut feeling about the gadgets I buy. And usually, I also wish to share that opinion. I will just dump my thoughts here so I won’t have to annoy my friends with stuff they don’t care about. Maybe someone cares.

##Gadgets
* **[My current audio setup](/reviews/audio-setup)**: a **Behringer XENYX X1222USB** mixer, **ADAM A7** active speakers and **Beyerdynamic DT-990** headphones.
* **[Sony A7](/reviews/sony-a7)**: my current camera, a full-frame, mirrorless and compact camera that plays well with my classic Leica and Zeiss lenses.
* **[Zeiss Vario-Tessar T* FE 24-70mm f/4 ZA OSS](/reviews/zeiss-24-70)**: a zoom lens for the camera above. I ultimately decided to send it back.

##Books
* **[Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) - Clean Coder](/reviews/cleancoder)**

The books list will grow in the foreseeable future. Here are some of the books that I am planning to cover:
