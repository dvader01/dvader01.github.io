I like books and gadgets. Who doesn't? Regarding the books, I read a lot but I also forget just as much. So I decided to take notes. That decision is years ago and I never did. So in order to force myself to take notes, I will do this publicly. The main purpose of these notes is that I can go back and refresh my memory about what I read some time ago. But if these notes are helpful for you as well in figuring out if you want to buy a book or not, so much the better. Regarding the gadgets, I usually have strong feelings, good or bad, about gadgets I buy and the wish to share that opinion. I will just dump my thoughts here so I won't have to annoy my friends with stuff they don't care about.
