This review is currently **under construction**. 

I was looking for a travel lens for my Sony A7. Usually I only use it with my **Leica prime** lenses but that did not seem all that attractive for the hiking trip in the mountains that I was about to embark on. I did not want to be the guy everyone is always waiting for because of being busy changing lenses instead of taking quick snapshots.

Sure, a **zoom lens** does sound more attractive when you need to camera ready to shoot anytime and for different angles. The biggest downside of zooms in general is that they are either not very fast or very heavy. It seems impossible to build a compact zoom lens that spans a moderate wide angle to a moderate telephoto lens and at the same time is as fast as F 2.8 or even better F2.0. If produced at all, at least this lens would be as heavy as a brick. But as a portrait lens, a 4.0 just doesn't cut it. This would **never** be my primary lens for anything except traveling.

Okay, so how does this lens fare as a travel lens? Let us look at the image quality first.

I have made large prints out of these two photos and the quality is okay. I am not excited about it but it is not terrible either. For a versatile travel lens, I could live with it. But there is one issue that for me makes this lens utterly useless as a camera for hiking trips and that is its size. It is way too bulky to carry around in a fanny pack. Now as a fashion choice, a fanny pack might be questionable anyway and usually is not my go to item in terms of accessories. But when hiking with other people, having the camera in the backpack is an option that guarantees that you will only take a fraction of the photos that you would otherwise take. It is pretty frustrating to take photos at all when you have to take off your backpack, and by the time you're done with the camera stowed, everyone else is probably already a few hundred meters ahead. Now do that again a few times and the next time you see your friends is at a break that they took but by the time you get there rushingly, they are ready to leave again, already giving you attitude that they had to wait for you, and you have not had a minute of rest at all.

So that was unpleasant and I would not want to use a camera setup of this size again at a mountaineering trip. Now what would be better? I found that in the mountains, almost all photos I took with the A7 and this lens were with the widest angle possible, so at 24mm. Some of the photos would also have made good use of an even wider angle. 

So next time, I think I only want to take a wide angle prime with 24mm or less. Zeiss is rumored to have a few additional lenses in the works, and I think I would enjoy a 21mm lens specifically made for this camera. But maybe that's not even necessary. Supposedly, the **Nikon 3,5/21** works really well with this camera / lens mount. 

The **Voigtländer**'s on the other hand supposedly have more issues towards the edges of the frame. If you think about it, that's not surprising at all. The Voigländer lenses are constructed for the **[Leica M](http://en.leica-camera.com/Photography/Leica-M/About-the-M-System)** camera family where the back of the lens can come really close to the **[film plane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_plane)**. For film this is okay as it does not matter for the silver ions from which angle rays of light hit the surface. For a digital sensor, that's a completely different story. And here's where the Nikon lens shines with its **[retro-focus](http://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/42536453)** design. 

A focal length of 21 mm in theory would mean that the distance between the lens and the focal plane is also 21mm. But in an **[SLR (single-lens reflex)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera)** like the Nikon, that's not possible because 21mm ahead of the focal plane you will find the mirror. The solution (found decades ago) is to construct a lens that despite a shorter focal length projects the resulting image on a film plane that is further away. This distance is called **[Flange Focal Distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flange_focal_distance)** and for **Nikon F mount**, it is **46.5mm**. Necessarily, the rays of light exiting the lens towards the sensor / film plane are much more parallel in comparison to the Leica M construction. The closer to a 90° angle, the better the image quality towards the edges.

## Conclusion
Not a terrible lens, well built and with decent optical performance but I still decided to send it back. That had less to do with the lens itself and more with my personal style of photography. Your mileage may vary and I have no doubts that this lens can be the work horse for making great photos. Check out more review on Amazon to learn more about this lens:
