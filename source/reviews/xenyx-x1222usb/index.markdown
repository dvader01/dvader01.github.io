Recently I blew a fuse and threw out my 80lbs Onkyo receiver together with the entire THX surround system. Okay, I did not literally threw that stuff out of the window but instead sold it for two point something grand. What had happened?

##Couple of reasons:
* I want to reorganize the apartment and the back speakers are in the way.
* I don't need surround sound at all, I much prefer a good stereo image. Really, surround this sucks you into what's going on on screen? Try a good story.
* I wanted to reduce my footprint, including power consumption. That Onkyo receiver was crazy power hungry. Even when idle you'd almost burn your fingers on it. The next thing that'll go is the Samsung 52 Plasma TV. That thing also doubles as a heater.
* Apple TV is horrible for a party. No sound is, too. The music playing (or not) makes the difference between the party being in full swing at 2 am or you already having the cleaning lights on at half past midnight. Well, if you are the kind of person who cleans right away, which I am decidedly not.
