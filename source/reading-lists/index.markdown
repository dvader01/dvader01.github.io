Here are some compilations of links that I have found useful for learning the respective technologies. Previously, these links lived in the isolation of their respective bookmarks folders, but they were **not getting enough love** there. So I thought I better **liberate** them. Maybe **you** will find these compilations useful as well, so I have put them on **GitHub**:

* <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/WebComponents-Polymer-Resources" target="_blank"><strong>Web Components and Polymer</strong></a>: Web Components and Polymer are fairly young an there are not a lot of resources out there yet. Have you found (or written) a good article covering these technologies? Please let me know.
* <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/Clojure-Resources" target="_blank"><strong>Clojure, ClojureScript and Om</strong></a>: Links I have found useful for starting to learn **Clojure**. Great talks are also included.

Please get involved and add your links as well. **Your contribution** is only **one pull request away**.
