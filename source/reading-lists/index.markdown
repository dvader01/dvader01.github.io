I needed a good way to keep track of articles and other resources about technologies that I am interested in so I started compiling lists for this purpose. Now chances are that other people will find these lists useful as well, so I have put them on **GitHub**:

* <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/WebComponents-Polymer-Resources" target="_blank"><strong>Web Components and Polymer</strong></a>
* <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/Clojure-Resources" target="_blank"><strong>Clojure, ClojureScript and Om</strong></a>: coming soon

Please get involved and add your links as well. Your contribution is only one pull request away.
