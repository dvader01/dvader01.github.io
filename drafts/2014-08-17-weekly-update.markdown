Yeah I really like a balanced full stack project. With the full stack under your control you can get a whole feature done without constantly having to negotiate with the other team. I find to be more productive that way.
I am using Octopress for generating the blog. It has served me alright, but I wouldn't use it again. I am just not enough of a Ruby guy to fix issues when I try to update it. Just tonight I wasted two precious hours on trying to get my installation current so that I would benefit from newer features, without success. And quite frankly I have no intentions of becoming a Ruby expert any time soon or ever. Along those lines, I was thinking about rolling my own, making use of Polymer and Web Components. Now that Google robots run JavaScript, the blog would get indexed just fine. Why not load the markdown directly from a web component handling the current post and then let that render itself? Polymer handles browser compatibility, but I do not care much about IE6 users and the like anyway. At the same time that would give me a chance to dive deeper into web components. The idea of a shadow DOM is just brilliant, and I hope web components will have the success they deserve. Finally a vendor-agnotic way of building web application.

Have a great week,
Matthias
