Today, just a quick thought about how valuable the first impressions from people new to a team could be, had we the guts to accept what we might learn.

Boiled frog symptom in software projects: a frog, suddenly thrown into hot water, will just jump right out. However, if the frog is placed in a pot with cold water with is then put on the stove will stay happily until it boils. After all, the current state was never as shocking as being thrown into hot water would have been. Sure, it's gotten a little warmer recently, but not much more so than a little while ago. This causes us to become blind to problems over time and it makes it particularly valuable to encourage people new to a team or organization to freely share their first impressions without fear of reprimand. However, I have not once experienced much interest in first impressions from people new to a team in a way that was fruitful and helped turn a situation around (including when I was new to a team). Why is that? Are we really that afraid of what we might hear? We should be better than that. And this is not only a structural thing that needs a formal feedback process. Sure, why not ask for a report on the first week. But each and every one of us could just ask the new colleague, hey, you have fresh eyes, what do you see so far? I think the workplace would be better if this was a part of the culture.
